# ACS Operator Index

This repository is for building the ACS (downstream) operator indexes on Konflux.


## Development

### Restarting Konflux job

Comment in the PR `/test <job_name>` (e.g. `/test operator-index-ocp-v4-16-on-push`).
See more in [our docs](https://spaces.redhat.com/display/StackRox/How+to+everything+Konflux+for+RHACS#HowtoeverythingKonfluxforRHACS-Howtore-runpipelines).

### Adding new ACS operator version

1. Open `catalog-template.yaml` file
2. Find the `stable` channel block. It starts with:
```yaml
- schema: olm.channel
  name: stable
```
3. Insert a new entry to the `entries` list. 
   - *Note:* Keep entries sorted by version (e.g. `4.9.1` should be before `4.9.2`)
   
   The entry should look like this:
   ```yaml
   - &bundle-4-Y-Z
     name: rhacs-operator.v4.Y.Z
     replaces: rhacs-operator.v4.PREVIOUS_Y.PREVIOUS_Z
     skipRange: '>= 4.PREVIOUS_CHANNEL_Y.0 < 4.Y.Z'
   ```
   Replace `Y`, `Z`, `PREVIOUS_Y`, `PREVIOUS_Z`, `PREVIOUS_CHANNEL_Y` accordingly.
   * `Y` is the minor component of the version (e.g. for 4.9.1 `Y` equals to 9)
   * `Z` is the patch component of the version (e.g. for 4.9.1 `Z` equals to 1)
   * `PREVIOUS_Y` is the minor component of the previous version (e.g. the previous version for 4.5.3 is 4.5.2 so`PREVIOUS_Y` equals to 5. For 4.3.0 `PREVIOUS_Y` is equal to 2)
   * `PREVIOUS_Z` is the minor component of the previous version (e.g. the previous version for 4.5.3 is 4.5.2 so`PREVIOUS_Z` equals to 2. For 4.3.0 `PREVIOUS_Z` is equal to 5 because the previous version is 4.2.5)
   * `PREVIOUS_CHANNEL_Y` is the minor component of the previous **channel** version (e.g. for 4.6.3 the previous channel is 4.5 so `PREVIOUS_CHANNEL_Y` is equal to 4)
   - *Note:* Add an empty line after the last entry if you add a new Y version with Z equals to 0 (e.g. 4.9.0). It helps visually separate different Y version in the list.
4. (For new Y version only where Z is equal to 0) Create a new channel block:
   ```yaml
   - schema: olm.channel
     name: rhacs-4.Y
     package: rhacs-operator
     entries:
   ```
   Replace `Y` accordingly.
   Keep the channel blocks sorted in ascending order (e.g. 4.6 goes after 4.5).
5. Find a channel block for your Y version and insert a new entry to the `entries` list. Use the yaml anchor declared on the 3d step (starts with `&`):
   ```yaml
   - schema: olm.channel
     name: rhacs-4.Y
     package: rhacs-operator
     entries:
      - *bundle-4-Y-Z
   ```
   Replace `Y` and `Z` accordingly.
6. Add a new block with operator bundle image for this version to the list:
   ```yaml
   - schema: olm.bundle
   # 4.Y.Z
   image: OPERATOR_BUNDLE_REGISTRY@OPERATOR_BUNDLE_SHA256
   ```
   Replace `Y`, `Z` accordingly.
   * `OPERATOR_BUNDLE_REGISTRY` set to `registry.redhat.io/advanced-cluster-security/rhacs-operator-bundle` for ready to release version. Use `brew.registry.redhat.io/rh-osbs/rhacs-operator-bundle` for release candidates.
   * `OPERATOR_BUNDLE_SHA256` the operator bundle SHA starts with `sha256:`. In order to fetch SHA find an email `[CVP] (SUCCESS) cvp-redhatadvancedclustersecurity: rhacs-operator-bundle-container-4.Y.Z-x` subject. Open `Brew Build Info` link and find the digest of the`registry-proxy.engineering.redhat.com/rh-osbs/rhacs-operator-bundle` image. Use the digest value for the `OPERATOR_BUNDLE_SHA256`.
7. Update catalogs (follow [updating catalogs steps](#updating-catalogs))
8. open a PR with `Add 4.Y.Z version` title



### Updating catalogs

Run
```
make clean && make valid-catalogs
```
Note: this will take a while.

If a new bundle was added then you should see that `catalog-bundle-object/rhacs-operator/catalog.json` and `catalog-csv-metadata/rhacs-operator/catalog.json` files are changed.

#### Historical note

The following documentation was used for setting up catalogs update ([this](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/konflux/docs/users/-/blob/main/topics/getting-started/building-olm-products.md) and [this](https://github.com/konflux-ci/olm-operator-konflux-sample/blob/main/docs/konflux-onboarding.md)).

### Getting built images for specific commit

Run `./scripts/get-built-images.sh [COMMIT]` to fetch built operator catalog images for the provided `COMMIT` for each supported OCP version.
*Note:* The script uses current branch commit if no `COMMIT` argument provided.

### Catalog formats

This directory contains two versions of the catalog, in subdirectories `catalog-bundle-object` and `catalog-csv-metadata`.
The former is expected by OpenShift versions up to and including 4.16, and the latter - by 4.17 and later.

See [konflux docs](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/blob/c93ea73dbc30b8be15615e4d230040c70a0cf826/task/fbc-validation/0.1/TROUBLESHOOTING.md?plain=1#L7-L8).

## Release File-based operator catalog

### Release process

1. Make sure you [logged in](https://spaces.redhat.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=407312060#HowtoeverythingKonfluxforRHACS-GettingocCLItoworkwithKonflux) to the Konflux cluster.
2. Make sure you checked out the latest master branch: `git checkout master && git pull`
3. Generate Release and Snapshot CRs by running `./scripts/generate-releases.sh <staging|prod>`. Use `staging` for test release and `prod` for production one.
4. (Skip for `staging` release.) Create a PR which adds the file created by the script, get the PR reviewed and merged.
5. (Skip for `staging` release.) Go to the [#acs-operator-index-release](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C096WU0GZUG) channel, and:
   1. make sure the previous operator index release is complete (has a green check mark emoticon)
   2. if not, coordinate with the person conducting that release
   3. once that release is complete, start a new thread for your release
6. Apply generated CRs to the cluster: `oc create -f release-history/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<SHA>-<staging|prod>.yaml`
7. Monitor release [using monitor release script](#monitoring-release). Each supported OCP version has its own `Release`. Successfully finished `Release` has `Succeeded` status.
8. Follow [the restarting release step below](#restarting-konflux-release) if any of the `Release`s fails for any OCP version.
9. (Skip for `staging` release.) Once done, go back to the Slack thread you started earlier, add a message that your release is done and add a green check mark emoticon on the initial message of the thread.
10. Once releases for all OCP versions successfully finish, then the operator catalog release is done. If you perform it as part of a bigger release procedure, you should go back to that procedure and continue with further steps.


### Monitoring Release

Run `./scripts/monitor-release.sh [COMMIT]` to see the current status for the releases associated with the provided `COMMIT`.
*Note:* The script uses current branch commit if no `COMMIT` argument provided.

### Restarting Konflux Release

If a particular Release fails (i.e. the CRs status changes to `Failed`), you should restart it until it succeeds. Failing to do so will leave corresponding OpenShift Operator catalog without updates.

1. Go to [the list of Konflux applications](https://konflux-ui.apps.stone-prd-rh01.pg1f.p1.openshiftapps.com/ns/rh-acs-tenant/applications).

</details>

2. Open `acs-operator-index-ocp-v4-XX` Konflux application for OCP version you want to restart (`XX` means minor part of the OCP version).
3. Select `Releases` tab.
4. Find release by name you want to restart.
5. Click on the action menu (3 dots) on the right.
6. Press "Re-run release" option. This creates a new Release CR.
7. Monitor the new release.
8. Repeat restarting release if the release keeps failing. If you find yourself re-running a given `Release` five times or more, open a high severity request in [#konflux-users](https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04PZ7H0VA8) Slack channel describing the problem and providing names/links to Release CRs.
