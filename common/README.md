# Catalog formats

This directory contains two versions of the catalog, in subdirectories `catalog-bundle-object` and `catalog-csv-metadata`.
The former is expected by OpenShift versions up to and including 4.16, and the latter - by 4.17 and later.

See [konflux docs](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/blob/c93ea73dbc30b8be15615e4d230040c70a0cf826/task/fbc-validation/0.1/TROUBLESHOOTING.md?plain=1#L7-L8).
